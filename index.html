        <p>I have been coding for about a year as of making this resume and it has been an amazing journey. I was
            ecstatic to find out what parts of this industry I excel at where I struggle and can improve in.</p>
        <p>As I am looking to enter this workforce, I hope that this site can reflect my personality and skills enough
            to
            make a serous difference.</p>

        <!-- Anchor tag for "Hobbies" button -->
        <a id="hobbies"></a>

        <p>I also have a lot of experience in high-paced work environments as both a worker and manager. I work well
            under pressure and am very well versed in both following a leader and leading a team myself.</p>

    <div class="hobbies-container">
        <h1>My Hobbies</h1>
        <p>My time spent not working on projects or at housework is usually spent a variety of ways. Either relaxing
            with a video game, playing Dungeons and Dragons or Magic: the Gathering with my friend group, or enjoying a
            game of one of the many sports teams I support.</p>
        <p>I grew up watching sports because of my family. They passed onto me their love for the Kansas City Chiefs,
            Kansas City Royals, Chicago Cubs, and Kansas-State Wildcats. We have gone to several games together and I
            was even born in Manhatten, KS where the K-State Wildcats are located.</p>
        <div class="hobby-image-container">
            <img src="Images/Hobbies_Images/ChiefsLogo.png" alt="Chiefs Logo" style="width: 400px; height: 300px;">
            <img src="Images/Hobbies_Images/RoyalsLogo.png" alt="Royals Logo" style="width: 340px; height: 300px;">
            <img src="Images/Hobbies_Images/CubsLogo.png" alt="Cubs Logo" style="width: 500px; height: 300px;">

                style="width: 500px; height: 300px;">
        </div>

        <p>Tabletop games and Magic immedietly called to me when I started playing them. The way you can make a
            character or build a deck to both be powerful and full of personality at the same time drew me in. It lets
            me have an interesting challenge on creating something that both I enjoy making and using but also something
            others would like interacting with, which is a mentatlity I like to take into my work.</p>
